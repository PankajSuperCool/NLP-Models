In result, the appeal from the conviction of break, enter the theft is allowed and is set aside. A conviction for theft, pursuant to count 2, is entered. The matter is remitted to the trial judge for resentencing.",outcome
"The appellant, Kevin Ausland, appeals his conviction for break, enter and theft pursuant to sections 348(1)(b) and (e) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C46 (Code). The facts are these. Rona Distribution Ltd. owns an overflow yard which is used for the purpose of storing trailers. The yard is a former parking lot of a drivein movie theatre and is unfenced. The only physical thing controlling access and egress to the property is a chain between two cement posts which spans the road giving vehicle access to the yard. While vehicular access to the yard is controlled by this means, there is no physical barrier impeding pedestrian access. The yard is patrolled by security guards and cameras. On the evening of September 7, 2007, two men were observed backing a truck tractor up to the chain. The chain was secured by a padlock. They apparently cut through the chain and backed the tractor unit up to a trailer parked in the lot. The tractor and trailer were connected and the unit was ready to be pulled, when the police arrived in response to an emergency call. In the end, nothing was removed from the yard. Ausland was charged and convicted of breaking and entering a place, and committing a theft therein. He was also found guilty of theft over $5,000, under section 334 of the Code, but that conviction was stayed under the principle set out in R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC),  1 S.C.R. 729.

"Furthermore, I cannot think that such a distinction would be in the minds of the parties to an “all risk” policy. There is no reason to suspect that an insured who buys an “all risk” policy in relation to a commercial building would intend the exclusion of settlement type damages arising from unnatural causes on the basis of this exclusion clause. Likewise, it is illogical to think that an insurer of an “all risk” policy would have intended to shield itself behind an exclusion clause if the accident produced settling, as opposed to any other type of damage. If the parties intended such an anomalous result, they should have said so in the contract. In the absence of express language to that effect, it seems clear that neither party intended that result and I conclude that the appellant’s position belies its intention at the time it entered into the contract. For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Judgment accordingly.",outcome
"The facts giving rise to the appeal are not disputed. The respondent owns a commercial building located on 13th Avenue and 1st Street S.W., Calgary. It leased the premises to a number of commercial tenants, and secured an “all risk” insurance policy. The appellant insurer later assumed the policy and renewed it from time to time, such that the policy was in effect at all relevant times. In July 2006, construction began on a highrise condominium project located adjacent to the respondent’s building. After the lot was excavated several stories deep, tenants in the respondent’s building began to notice cracks developing in the floors, walls and ceilings. They complained to the respondent, who reported the matter to the appellant. All agreed that the building had been in good condition and repair prior to the commencement of the construction. The respondent’s proof of loss claim was denied by the appellant on the basis that the policy excludes loss or damage caused by earth movement and settlement. The respondent retained Anast Demitt, a structural engineer, to inspect the building to ascertain the cause and extent of the damage, and to estimate the cost of repair. Mr. Demitt concluded that the damage was caused by the excavation activity on the adjacent lot, specifically by inadequate underpinnings and shoring, together with vibrations, shaking and the destabilizing effects of the deep excavation. He found that, as a result, the respondent’s building sustained settlement of the structural frame and the floor slabs. Photographs, entered by agreement in the court below, show extensive damage to the building with massive cracks in the floors, walls and ceilings. Mr. Demitt estimated the cost of repair to be in the range of $1,000,000. His report itself did not form part of the evidence, but was described in the affidavit of Raphael Engle. The question of the appellant’s liability was put before a chambers judge. By then, the appellant had abandoned its argument that the earth movement exclusion clause applied and relied solely on the settlement exclusion clause to deny coverage.",facts

"The applicant’s materials contain no evidence of irreparable harm and no evidence to establish that the balance of convenience would favour a stay. Indeed, it is notable that the orders which the applicant seeks to appeal specifically provide that the adoption out of the animals is without prejudice to any claim for damages and costs. The applicant’s materials do not satisfy me that the proposed appeal is not an abuse of process and that there are reasonable grounds for the appeal. Therefore, leave to file a Notice of Appeal is denied. Moreover, the materials do not meet the tripartite test for a stay. The applications are dismissed.",outcome
"The applicant, who is the subject of a Vexatious Litigant Order, applies for leave to file a Notice of Appeal and, if leave is granted, for a stay of certain portions of two Orders pronounced on December 21, 2009 and January 5, 2010. The two orders arise in proceedings instituted by the applicant following the seizure by the respondent of some animals in the applicant’s possession. Amongst other things, the December 21 order establishes a procedure for adoption out by the respondent of some of the seized animals. It provides that if any of the animals are adopted out under the procedure, the adoption is without prejudice and without admission of liability by either the applicant or the respondent. The January 5 order provides that after 5:00 p.m. on January 12, 2010 the respondent may adopt out any of the remaining animals and that the adoption out of any animals will be without prejudice to any future claims for damages and costs. In essence, the applicant wishes to appeal these adoption out provisions and to have them stayed pending the hearing of the appeal.",facts

The Calgary Airport Authority and Ayron Developments Inc. (Ayron) entered into a construction lease in which Ayron agreed to build 20 airplane hangers (the Head Lease). Ayron registered its leasehold interest with Land Titles. One of the terms of the Head Lease was that Ayron would not allow any builders’ liens to remain registered against title.,facts
"In January 2003, Ayron contracted with A.S.4. Steel Ltd. (AS4) to build the hangers. At the same time, Ayron sublet the 20 hangers to a number of different parties including a corporation that in turn assigned its interest in the sublease to the appellant, Leigh Schubert (Schubert). The sublease was not registered with Land Titles.",facts
"On March 17, 2004, AS4 filed a builders’ lien against Ayron’s leasehold interest claiming the sum of $425,000 owed. On March 26, 2004, AS4 filed a Statement of Claim seeking payment of $368,549, and on July 30, 2004, filed a certificate of lis pendens for both its builders’ lien and its civil claim.

"The appellant, Mary Donnelly, operates a horse breeding and training facility called Alborak Stables (Alborak) within the respondent Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8 (the MD). The stable sits on lands classified “Agricultural Conservation” district, as defined by Land Use Bylaw No. 16/96 (the Bylaw). Permitted uses within the district include “extensive agriculture” and “accessory buildings”, also defined by the Bylaw. As this appeal turns on the interpretation of a 2003 Stop Order, it is important to understand the history and context of that order and the order under appeal.",facts
"The appellant has resided on the lands since 1981. On September 30, 1996, she applied to the MD for a development permit to construct an “Accessory Building (Breeding and Training Building)” (Accessory Building). The appellant’s daughter, Sandra Donnelly, submitted a letter outlining Alborak’s business, which included taking horses from other breeders for training and sale. She stated: The type of operation which will be run from this location is no different than what is currently run on this quarter. We currently breed cattle and sell the calves each fall which is the most economic time for us to sell them. We have been buying young horses, training them, and selling them at a profit. We have also been training horses for other breeders, mostly on share basis, so we actually own a percentage of these horses. These breeders do not have significant involvement in the training of the horses and are similar to owners of cattle in feedlots.",facts

" The parties separated in 2004 and were divorced in 2008. They have two children, aged 14 and 13, who reside with the appellant mother. The appellant appeals a chambers order which declined to impute income to the respondent for child support purposes for the period July 2006 to December 2007? imputed income for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and ordered the respondent to deposit $100,000.00 as security for future child support. The appellant argues that the chambers judge erred in declining to impute income for July 2006 to December 2007? in not imputing more income for the years 2008 to 2010? and in failing to grant a lump sum for future support with appropriate security. The lengthy history of this matrimonial dispute is outlined in the reasons of the Chambers Judge: S.L.T. v. A.K.T., 2010 ABQB 121 (CanLII), 2010 ABQB 121 (the Chambers Decision).",facts
 The appellant argues that the Chambers Judge erred in failing to award a lump sum for future support and in failing to grant sufficient security for payment of future support. The appellant concedes that lump sum future support is a rare remedy but asserts that it is appropriate in this case given the history of litigation between the parties. The Chambers Judge was aware of the history but she declined to award a lump sum for future support because there was no evidence to form the basis for an accurate calculation. We are in no better position. Nor are we able to conclude that the security ordered by the Chambers Judge is unreasonable.,outcome

At the time that order was granted, it was understood he was the biological father of the child. J.B. was not living with the mother at the time of birth. In fact, an order for payment of funds and maintenance had been made to the mother. As a result of subsequent paternity testing it turns out that J.B. is not the biological father.",facts

"Colledge purchased the residential property in June 2008. In November 2008, a complaint was made about large vehicles (semi­truck and trailer, as well as a bobcat) being stored on the site. An information report was sent to Colledge advising of the complaint and the rules relative to storing of large vehicles on a residential lot. However, the property continued to be used for that purpose, and, following further complaints by neighbours, and subsequent investigations by a development officer, the stop order was ultimately issued on March 5, 2009.The property is situate within an area annexed to the City of Calgary in 2007. Since June 1, 2008, the subject area has been designated by the City as Special Purpose – Future Urban Development (S­FUD) District, pursuant to Land Use Bylaw IP 2007 (LUB IP2007).Prior to annexation, the land was situate in the Municipal District of Rocky View No. 44 (MD of Rocky View) and governed by Land Use Bylaw C­4841­97 (LUB C­4841­97). The property at that time was designated as Hamlet Residential Single Family District (HR ­1). LUB C­4841­97 came into effect on September 29, 1998.A development permit for an accessory building had been issued on January 31, 1994, pursuant to earlier Land Use Bylaw C­17284 of the MD of Rocky View. The property was zoned thereunder for single family residential use.The accessory building was a garage intended to house the resident’s gravel truck and trailer. The garage was oversized for the lot. The development permit relaxed both the maximum size requirement for the garage and the total building area for all accessory buildings. The permit included conditions that it would not be issued until a building permit had been issued for a single family dwelling on the parcel, and further that the accessory building would not be used for commercial purposes at any time.",facts

"A constable with the Calgary Police Service obtained a general search warrant for a residence owned by the appellant in Calgary. The constable, who prepared the Information to Obtain a Search Warrant (ITO) and was experienced in drug possession and trafficking investigations, stated she had information which led her to reasonably believe there was a marijuana grow operation located therein. Initially, the constable received a Crime Stoppers tip of suspicious activity at the appellant’s property. Specifically no one appeared to live in the house, an Asian male driving a Jaguar had visited the residence, the windows were covered, and condensation was on basement windows and the back door. The constable conducted a physical reconnaissance of the building and noted, amongst other things, corrugated plastic covering the lower windows of the two story house and a brown stain running down the siding. A police search indicated that the appellant’s phone number corresponded to a residence where other residents had been charged with drug related offences.Based on the constable’s information, a detective with the Calgary drug unit requested a DRA be attached to the electrical supply line for the house which was outside the property line. The DRA recorded when electricity was consumed at the property. Over five days in February 2005, an approximate 18‐hour cycling pattern was recorded, being a pattern common to marijuana grow operations. Furthermore, the police also determined that the person listed as the utilities subscriber for the residence in question, Kin K. Ngai, was also the listed utilities subscriber for another residence which had been the subject of a previous search warrant that had yielded a marijuana grow operation with 778 plants. The appellant and Kin K. Ngai also appeared to share the same phone number but Kin K. Ngai did not appear to be an actual person. The warrant was obtained based upon the following information: a. The Crime Stoppers Tip; b. The DRA results for the residence located at [...] West Springs Close South West Calgary, Alberta c. The concealed windows; d. The moisture staining on the east side of the residence.e. The PIMS Inquiries that Kin Wa NGAI [...] lived with individuals charged with drug related offences. f. Kin K. NGAI, the utilities subscriber for the residence of [...] West Springs Close South West, Calgary Alberta, does not exist as a person, but uses the phone number of Kin Wa NGAI [...]. g. Kin K NGAI, who was also the utilities subscriber for the residence of [...] Valley Creek Crescent North West, Calgary Alberta, which had a cannabis marijuana grow operation inside the residence with seven hundred seventy eight (778) plants. The warrant – executed in March 2005 – revealed that the property was being used as a sophisticated marijuana grow operation and approximately 1,600 plants were seized. The appellant was present at the time of the search and was arrested. At trial, the appellant sought to exclude the evidence alleging a violation of section 8 of the Charter because the DRA was installed without prior judicial authorization. The appellant further argued the ITO was deficient because some of the information was not properly challenged and some not within the personal knowledge of the affiant constable. The appellant also sought to cross examine the constable on the location of the search warrant during its execution but was prohibited by the trial judge from pursuing this line of inquiry. The appellant filed a Notice of Constitutional Question to challenge section 1(e) and section 10(3) of the Code of Conduct Regulation, AR 160/2003, enacted pursuant to the Electrical Utilities Act, S.A. 2003, c. E­5.1 (Regulation), which permitted disclosure to the police by a utility of data relating to electrical consumption. The appellant submitted that the definition of “customer information” in s. 1(e) did not include the DRA information in the ITO, and so s. 10(3) (f) did not authorize the seizure of the DRA information without a warrant. Further, he submitted s. 13 of the Regulation appeared to contemplate the disclosure of consumption data only with the customer’s consent. To the extent the sections authorized warrantless searches, those sections contravened section 8 of the Charter and could not be saved by section 1. The Crown submitted that when the sections were read in their plain and ordinary meaning they permitted the use of DRAs and external searches for information about the home which might give rise to an inference about what is going on inside, depending on other evidence available. The Crown said there was no invasion of a privacy interest relying on the decisions in R. v. Plant, 1993 CanLII 70 (SCC),  3 S.C.R. 281, 84 C.C.C. (3d) 203, and R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67 (CanLII),  3 S.C.R. 432. The Crown further submitted that the computer records could not reasonably be said to reveal intimate details of a person’s life since electrical consumption reveals very little about the personal life, lifestyle or private decisions of the occupant, and there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in such information.",facts

The trial judge, however, miscalculated the relative fault of the parties: the appellant was 40 per cent responsible, and the respondent Michel Mahe was 60 per cent responsible.

"The appellant owns a farm, which for many years had a power pole in the yard. The pole was old and had started to rot, and in addition the appellant wanted a brighter light because of a break­in he had experienced. The appellant arranged for the installation of a new pole 3 feet away from the old one. He then retained the respondent electrician (who had done work for him in the past) to transfer the wiring from the old pole to the new pole. The appellant suggested that access to the two poles could be obtained by backing a truck up to them, building a platform on top of the truck, and then leaning a ladder mounted on the platform against the poles. The respondent accepted this method of doing the work. The respondent commenced working on the poles without any safety harness or other precautions. The respondent installed the new light, and was in the process of moving the wiring from the old pole to the new pole. When he disconnected the second­last of the wires connected to the old pole, tension in the pole from the wire was released, and the pole twisted and vibrated. The pole broke or fractured near its base. It did not fall as it was still attached to the last of the electrical wires, and because the respondent had tied it to the new pole to minimize the movement of the pole when the lines were detached. It appears to have twisted or rotated around its remaining supports. The twisting or vibration was sufficient to throw the respondent to the ground, where he suffered very serious injuries.",facts

"Mr. Baradoy appeals a chambers decision requiring him to continue to pay the respondent, his former wife, spousal support in the amount of $1000 per month. The parties were married for 26 years and separated in 2004. They executed a spousal support and property agreement in March 2005, which provided that the appellant would pay $1000 per month to the respondent. This provision was incorporated into the divorce judgment granted in January 2006. The judgment provided for a review of support in September 2008. The appeal arises from that review. The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the facts and failed to consider all the relevant evidence in determining entitlement to, and quantum of, spousal support, and that she erred in her application of the case law on spousal support with regard to self­sufficiency. The chambers judge reviewed the evidence, and concluded that at the time of separation the respondent was entitled to spousal support. Had there been an application for spousal support at that time, she opined, there was a reasonable likelihood that the award would have exceeded $1000. We agree with that observation.""",facts

"Certain of the background facts were not disputed. Prior to the events in question, the complainant and the appellant were strangers. On the night in question, the complainant was accompanied by a male friend. The appellant was also in the company of a male friend. The two groups met outside a nightclub in the early hours of the morning. The initial meeting was instigated by the complainant, who asked the appellant and his friend if she could sell them some personal items to raise money for a cab ride home. This initial contact quickly became adversarial and confrontational, and resulted in an argument. The appellant testified that he was asked where drugs could be obtained, which he viewed as being a result of racial stereotyping. The appellant testified he was in a rant and swearing, and ended up chasing the complainant and her friend. At this point, the complainant’s friend left. What happened next is disputed, but it is agreed that the appellant and the complainant soon ended up engaging in oral sex behind a nearby school. Within a short time after that, the complainant appeared at the nearby home of a stranger, crying and distraught and complaining of a sexual assault. Both the complainant and the appellant testified. The complainant testified that the appellant forced her to go behind the school, and that she did not consent to the sexual contact. The appellant testified that after the initial confrontational contact the complainant became friendly, accompanied him behind the school, and willingly engaged in sexual activity. The appellant testified that the complainant offered to exchange sex for a place to stay. The only live issue at the trial was consent, and the credibility of the complainant and the appellant was key. The trial judge noted certain inconsistencies in the evidence. She held that she did not believe the testimony of the accused, and that it did not raise a reasonable doubt in her mind. She accepted the evidence of the complainant, and convicted the accused of sexual assault. """,facts

The matters have been set down for trial in January 2010.",facts
"E.C. was initially granted bail in May 2008 on certain conditions that included what was described as “24 hour house arrest”. This provision purported to confine E.C. to his place of residence 24 hours a day, seven days a week with a number of exceptions. Specifically, the conditions indicated that E.C. was to be at his place of residence “24 hours a day, 7 days per week unless (A) at school, place of employment, or professional employment, or travelling directly to or from same, and unless permission signed by a parent specifying the reason for the young person’s absence from his residence and fixing a return time, (B) accompanied by a parent, (C) in possession of a written permission signed by a probation officer, (D) attending coaching activities at [a high school] [between certain hours and until a certain date] and travelling directly to and from the same, (E) to attend athletic training as authorized in writing in advance by the probation officer no later that 10:00 p.m. (sic) to attend athletic competitions as authorized in writing by the probation officer in advance. The young person shall provide all schedule (sic) once a week in writing of all training, coaching, competitions in advance to the probation officer.” The exception that was the subject of the review was E.C.’s parents’ ability to give him permission to be away from home by writing a note.",facts
"The incident that gave rise to the charges was serious. There were allegations that weapons were used, including golf clubs and tasers, in an early-morning semi-organized fight between two groups of young male high school students. Several people were injured and one of the victims was seriously injured. There were witnesses to the event and at least one of the witnesses implicated E.C. in the use of a weapon and with being near the most seriously injured victim.",facts
"E.C. has no criminal record. He is a gifted athlete and trains extensively in his sport. He takes high school courses on-line and by correspondence and works part-time. The bail conditions were negotiated between the Crown and defence counsel prior to being submitted to a justice of the peace for approval. They recognized, implicitly, E.C.’s training schedule, his work commitments and his volunteer activities.",facts
"As a result, what was characterized as a 24 hour house arrest actually had a number of exceptions that allowed E.C. to be away from home frequently. The exception that allowed E.C.’s parents to give him permission to be out of the residence allowed them a discretion that was impossible for the Crown or the police to control. Problems arose when police, relying in the characterization of the conditions as 24 hour house arrest, attended at E.C.’s home to check for breaches, only to find on a few occasions that he was away from home with his mother’s express permission. Despite the Crown’s agreement to this condition at the original bail hearing, the Crown brought an application to vary the condition before a judge of the Provincial Court, Youth Justice division.",facts

Mr. Johnson had experience and knowledge, and was happy to help a younger farmer like Mr. Mossey. This relationship was not one-sided, but mutually beneficial. Ms. Virostek described their relationship as close, but stated her father never treated Mr. Mossey as a son. From all the evidence it appears that the two men got along extremely well and notwithstanding Ms. Virostek’s unwillingness to concede a father-son relationship, it appears that Mr. Johnson played the role of adopted father to Mr. Mossey starting in 1973. At a minimum, the men were close friends and trusted each other in both business and personal matters.",facts

Furthermore, the evidence is not probative of a fact in issue as the fact that the Plaintiff may have been of good character and reputation in the warehouse and in the community is irrelevant to whether he committed the specific incidents of sexual harassment.

Remaining in Calgary would leave them in their mother’s primary custody, with frequent contact with their father, but likely subject to more financial uncertainty.

Holmberg, who owned a farm at the time, also worked as a self employed farmer from approximately April 1 to September 30 each year.The WCB accepted Holmberg’s claim on March 10, 1998. It recognized that he was temporarily totally disabled. Although it was aware that he worked as a farmer, initially the WCB did not take into account his farm earnings in calculating his compensation rate, but rather based it solely on his employment as a truck driver. In September 1998, Holmberg advised the WCB that he was having difficulty operating farm machinery and did not believe he could return to farming. By October 16, 1998, the WCB determined that Holmberg would not be able to return to his pre-accident employment as a truck driver, but was of the view that he was fit for some medium level of employment.Holmberg found employment as a farm equipment sales person, commencing October 19, 1998.

Having said that however, mere allegations are not sufficient and there must be evidence upon which the Court can conclude that this threshold test, however low it is, has been met. In this particular case this action is apparently part of a series of litigation matters ongoing between Ms. Long and Mr. Eastwick, and the proposed action is with respect to a company that has ceased business operations and is insolvent. I conclude that Ms. Long has met the low standard required of her to commence an action in the name of the company.

"Accordingly there does not appear to be anything in the Psychological/Parenting Assessment Report from November 2009, and the other materials that the Accused has supplied me with, that would cause me to conclude that the Accused could not or should not see the child.Strictly speaking I am not dealing with the “best interests of the child” test given that this is a bail review matter, and the Accused does have rights to be considered here. I also note that the Provincial Court Division charged with dealing with ensuring that the best interests of the child are protected has not based on the Record that I have been given come to any final decision with respect to the Director’s Apprehension request. The last Order that I was provided with by the Accused was an Order for initial custody issued in Family Court on October 8, 2009 which allows the father to have reasonable access to the child on a supervised basis in the discretion of the Director. Based on this Record, the final decision with respect to the Director’s Apprehension Order has not yet been made, something that the Accused confirms in his submissions before me.As such I conclude that the Provincial Court Order of December 23, 2009 remains extant, and the Accused is permitted to have contact with his child if the visits are coordinated with a social worker and are supervised. In order for that Variation Order to be effective, the social workers must cooperate and provide the father with supervised access times on a reasonable basis with the child as soon as possible. Therefore the Accused’s application for further Variation taken out in this Court is granted and the social workers in question will provide the Accused with notice of reasonable supervised visitation date and times as soon as possible.",outcome

"The Municipal Government Board supervises the assessment of real property by municipalities in Alberta including the City of Calgary. In doing so, it is required to “ensure fair and equitable assessment of property” and to ensure that the statutory assessment complaint process is administered in an “efficient and effective manner”. This process requires a “balancing of competing policy objectives and the interests of various constituencies”. (Edmonton (City) v. North Pointe Community Church, (2008) ABQB 110 at para. 22.The Applicant owns a home in the Elbow Park area of the City of Calgary. After receiving his 2006 residential property tax assessment which set the value of his property at $520,000, the Applicant sought a reduction on the basis that it was excessive. A hearing was held before a three- member panel of the Board on September 21, 2006. The Applicant argued that the assessment did not adequately recognize the market value given the condition of the property and negative factors such as the influence of the traffic flow given the property’s location. A written decision was issued on February 15, 2007, declining the reduction sought as well as further disclosure of the City’s supporting information of the assessment. On March 12, 2007, the Applicant requested a rehearing or a reconsideration of the same issues without providing any additional information and no new evidence.The Board then considered section 504 and section 523 of the Municipal Government Act R.S.A. 2000, c. M-26, and denied the request for a rehearing. It released its brief written decision on dated April 18, 2007, which concluded that the there were no sufficient grounds to support a rehearing which would satisfy its Procedure Guide requirements and that the fact that the Applicant simply disagreed with the decision was not enough.The Applicant filed an Originating Notice of Motion on October 9, 2007 seeking judicial review of the decisions naming the Municipal Government Board as the Respondent. In August 2009, he amended his Originating Notion of Motion adding the City of Calgary as a party. He asks this Court to quash the Board’s decision denying him a rehearing by granting the writ of certiorari.This judicial review follows numerous other similar applications the Applicant has made questioning the assessment decisions regarding his residential property commencing with the 1999 assessment year. The main thrust of these appeals are the same– the disclosure of the supporting information the City has used to establish the value of his property for residential taxation purposes.

Marine Drive also runs in a slightly southerly to northerly direction at that location but, for the sake of simplicity, I will refer only to the predominant directions).

When the police executed their search warrant, there were three “youths” around the kitchen table with marihuana paraphernalia, including a girl who was about 12 years old. She was not Mr. Bodaly’s daughter, but the daughter was, we may infer, being exposed to the marihuana operation in the house where she lives.",facts

There would a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., except when Mr. Bodaly is attending to go to work or to attend rehabilitation or counselling programs or sessions. 2. He must attend and participate in rehabilitation substance abuse and other counselling programs that may be recommended by his probation officer, whether Aboriginal-based or otherwise. 3.

Furthermore, the engagement letter is a contract only with the landlord.

The federal legislation is paramount and renders the provincial activity inoperable.

"The trial judge also was correct in finding that the claimants’ s. 7 interests of the right to life, liberty and security of the person were engaged by the anticipated expiry of the s. 56 constitutional exemption for the staff and clientele of Insite. However, in my view, the trial judge erred in law in finding that s. 4(1) of the CDSA was arbitrary, disproportionate and overbroad and therefore did not accord with the
principles of fundamental justice. There was simply no evidence to support that finding in the context of meeting the state’s broader interests of health and public safety.",outcome

"The trial judge varied the Will by providing a lump sum of $100,000 to each of the grandchildren and directing that the remainder of the estate of approximately $800,000 be divided equally between Janet Graham and Sandi Chalmers. The order was obviously premised on the increase in value of the estate between the date of Mrs. Graham’s death to the trial date. The variation of $100,000 to each of the grandchildren would otherwise not be logical in the context of the value of the estate at the testatrix’s death and the court’s finding that adequate provision had not been made for Janet Graham. Although there are practical reasons for expressing the division in this manner in this case (where the estate has been liquidated and is held in trust), there are pitfalls in doing so. There may be cases in which the estate is made up of unliquid assets the value of which may fluctuate between the date of death, the trial date, and distribution of the estate. In those cases, it is preferable to express the order in terms of percentages, except of course, in respect of specific bequests that are not disturbed by the variation. The potential difficulty that might arise is that the specific bequest directed by the variation order could, in extreme circumstances of a precipitous decline in the value of the residue, eliminate the intended gift to residual beneficiaries.

The reasons for judgment are indexed at 2009 BCSC 12. Mr. McLean, described in the trial as a small time cocaine dealer, lived with several room-mates in a large home on Humber Road in Victoria.

The appellant recruited Mr. Biros and Mr. Sproule to participate with him in what they both testified was intended to be a robbery of Mr. McLean’s cash.

"Under the requirements to pay issued by the Minister under s. 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act and s. 317(3) of the Excise Tax Act in February 2000, Canfor was required to pay monies otherwise payable to Baer to the Receiver General, notwithstanding the existence of the lien claims under the Woodworker Lien Act. The Minister had priority over the lien claimants to the monies paid into court by Canfor. I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the chambers judge, and order that the funds in court, to the extent of the amounts owing under the requirements to pay, be paid to the Minister.",outcome
"The competing claims arise from unremitted payroll source deductions and goods and services tax owed to the Minister by Baer Enterprises Ltd. (“Baer”), a logging contractor. Baer failed to remit payroll source deductions of approximately $95,000, and GST, in 1998 and 1999. ",facts

 Meade v. Armstrong (City),dec_name
Counsel for the Respondent: G. Murray,counsel
The Honourable Mr. Justice Smith,judge
"Accordingly, the extensions of time sought by Mr. Meade are granted and leave to appeal is granted. As well, leave to amend the notice of application for leave to appeal is granted. Further, proceedings below, including the order for security for costs, will be stayed pending this appeal.",outcome
"In June 2005, following the breakdown of his marriage, Mr. Meade moved
with all of his possessions onto a large residential property in the City of Armstrong where he resided in his travel trailer with the agreement of the owners, an elderly couple who were his friends. His possessions included, in addition to the trailer he used as his residence, two vehicles, a utility trailer, a portable shed, furniture, computer equipment, files, and numerous family keepsakes, the detritus of his failed marriage. The male friend died suddenly in August 2005 and Mr. Meade subsequently agreed with the widow that he and his possessions could remain until May 31, 2006. Near the end of October 2005 the widow moved from the property to a residential care home. Shortly thereafter, in November 2005, the City ordered Mr. Meade to vacate the trailer and he moved out, leaving his possessions on the property pursuant to the agreement. Then, on December 5, 2005, the City issued an order to the widow to comply with the “City of Armstrong Unsightly Premises Bylaw” and the “City of Armstrong Zoning Bylaw” by removing objects alleged to contravene the bylaws by December 20, 2005, or face removal of same by the City. The widow’s son advised Mr. Meade to remove his goods immediately, but he did not do so. However, he moved many of them into a large shed on the property. He says he did so because City officials advised him they would not remove the contents of the shed. Nevertheless, during March 2006, the City removed all Mr. Meade’s possessions from the property, including those in the shed, and disposed of them.
In Mr. Meade’s view, City officials acted clandestinely in concert with the son in order to assist him to gain possession of the property free and clear of Mr. Meade’s agreement with the widow and his possessions.",facts

"I would allow the sentence appeal, and substitute for the $50,000 fine a fine of $5,000 with six months to pay. In view of the trial judge’s comment that the fine would go to the “Government of Canada”, I think it best to clarify that the proceeds of the fine will become the property of the Province of British Columbia in accordance with s. 734.4(1) of the Criminal Code.",outcome
"The accused initially elected to be tried in Supreme Court, but consented to committal without a preliminary inquiry. In June 2008, he re-elected to be tried in Provincial Court, and pleaded guilty to the two counts. By consenting to committal and entering guilty pleas, the appellant obviated the need for either complainant to testify. Sentencing was put over to August 2008 so that a pre-sentence and psychological report could be prepared, but there were further delays, and the matter did not come on for hearing until November 14, 2008. At that time, counsel advised the court that they would be making a joint submission, and filed an agreed statement of facts, as well as a pre-sentence and psychological report. A psychologist engaged by the defence also testified at that time. The facts upon which the sentencing proceeded were quite limited. With respect to the count on which the fine was imposed, the agreed facts were that the appellant, on numerous occasions when the complainant was between 5 and 10 years old, rubbed her crotch through her clothes. He also kissed her on the neck on a number of occasions when she emerged from a bath or shower. No victim impact statement was filed with respect to the offence.",facts

"On May 24, 2003, anhydrous ammonia, which is used in the refrigeration system at the Dawson Facility, escaped from a pressure regulator valve and dripped from overhead onto meat products belonging to Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (“Maple Leaf”) that were being stored at the facility under the terms of a contract between Versacold and Maple Leaf.",facts
"The meat products were ultimately deemed by government food inspectors to be unfit for the purposes intended by Maple Leaf. Maple Leaf made a claim to Versacold for reimbursement for $365,795.27. Versacold notified its insurers of the claim and filed the necessary proofs of loss. Versacold then paid Maple Leaf the entire amount of its claim for the value of the meat products. Versacold was subsequently able to sell some of the damaged stock at a salvage value of $57,446.97.",facts
"The defendant insurers, with the exception of Commonwealth, paid Versacold their proportionate shares of the amount claimed under the Policy, taking into account the deductible provided for in the Policy and the amount that had been recovered for salvage. Commonwealth declined to pay the claim and Versacold brought this action.",facts
"There is no dispute that it was anhydrous ammonia that dripped onto Maple Leaf’s meat products, or that the ammonia exited the refrigeration system from a default pressure regulator valve that is an integral part of the system at Versacold’s Dawson Facility. The valve was also referred to by witnesses and counsel as a “bypass” valve, or a “defrost relief regulator”. I shall refer to the default pressure regulator valve as “the valve” or “the leaking valve” in these Reasons.",facts
"Although the court was provided with a detailed description and diagram of the refrigeration system and of the components of the valve, little turns on its exact function or location. The valve is part of a system of pipes and valves located high above the warehouse floor designed to maintain an appropriate temperature for refrigerated goods stored in the warehouse.",facts
"Michael Walker has been the Chief Operating Engineer at Versacold’s Dawson Facility since 1988. He was not on duty when the leak was discovered by another Versacold employee, (May 24, 2003 was a Saturday) but he immediately responded to the report of a leak by going to the Facility to check out the situation. Mr. Walker testified that when he arrived at the warehouse, liquid could be seen leaking from the valve. Some of the liquid ammonia had dripped on to Maple Leaf meat products stored on the warehouse floor. He estimated that between 40 to 80 pounds of anhydrous ammonia had leaked from the valve prior to his arrival at the warehouse.",facts
"Having concluded that there is no coverage for the loss sustained by Versacold under either the Property or Warehouseman’s Legal Liability provisions of the Policy, I must dismiss Versacold’s claim.",outcome

"The Landlord took ownership of the Seafield on July 31, 2008. Generally, landlords may only increase rent annually, and only up to the amount prescribed by the Act and the Residential Tenancy Act Regulation, B.C. Reg. 477/2003 (the “Regulation”). In certain circumstances, a landlord may apply for a rent increase above the annual rent increase allowed by statute. In January 2009, the Landlord applied to increase the rent for 13 units by between 53.2 and 73.3 percent (according to the Tenants’ calculations). The Tenants opposed the rent increases on the basis that the statutory criteria for permitting an additional rent increase were not met.",facts

After some further investigation, the police decided that the report was baseless and closed the file.",facts

Mr. Asad repeatedly asked Kinexus to disclose the identity of the person. Kinexus withheld the identity of Ms. Stoute at her request, but confirmed that it was a colleague who had reported him.",facts
"Mr. Asad continued to be employed by Kinexus for another 18 months. During that time, problems arose between Mr. Asad and Kinexus management. Mr. Asad believed that he was owed compensation for overtime he had worked.

He attended university in Saudi Arabia and graduated with a degree in biochemistry, following which he worked as a lab technician. Upon arriving in Vancouver, he had difficulty finding work in his field. He was interested in information technology, and decided to enrol in the Business Administration—Technical Computer Professional Program at Capilano College. He obtained a diploma in the program in May 2001. In August, 2000, while still attending Capilano College, Mr. Asad was hired by Kinexus.",facts

A day or so later, according to Mr. Asad, the accountant working for Kinexus, Mira Karia, was chatting with Ms. Sutter when Mr. Asad joined them. Ms. Karia reportedly said, “Isn’t it suspicious that Ghassan is Arab and Muslim, and he went to New York and Washington?” and then laughed. According to Mr. Asad, Ms. Karia made similar comments to Ms. Stoute.",facts

"On December 4, 2004, the plaintiff signed an agreement entitled “Sale of Business – Fee Agreement” (the “December Fee Agreement”) with the defendant, then called Syscon Justice Systems Ltd. That company is now called Syscon Justice Systems Canada Ltd., but I will refer to it hereafter as “Syscon Justice Systems Ltd.” Syscon Justice Systems Ltd. owned the other operating companies within the Syscon Enterprise. The agreement was for a term of 5 years, and provided that “the terms and conditions of the Fee Agreement cannot and will not be modified or revoked, unless by written agreement signed by both parties.”On the evidence that I have heard to date, it is clear that the principals of both parties to the December Fee Agreement agreed that that agreement should be renegotiated; however, mutually agreed upon changes to the December Fee Agreement were arguably never reached and no written agreement modifying or changing the agreement was signed by the principals of the two parties to the agreement.",facts

In the alternative, the defendants ask that Mr. Movassaghi be required to produce an affidavit verifying his 11th Supplementary List of Documents, that he produce all communications between himself and legal counsel in respect of a voluntary disclosure to the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”), that he attend at a continuation of his examination for discovery; and finally that the plaintiffs pay special costs to the defendants forthwith following taxation.",facts

Appearances: Counsel for Crown: Shelley Nixon Counsel for Defence: Peter Jensen,counsel
The Honourable Mr. Justice Truscott,judge
"It is my conclusion that the drug evidence should not be admitted at trial. R. v. Silveira says it will only be in rare cases that such evidence should be admitted on a warrantless search of a residence even in exigent circumstances. This is not one of those cases, in my view. Here, I have concluded that this was not a true 911 call and the search was not carried out in exigent circumstances. Constable Babala had no objectively reasonable suspicion from the contents of the Sarah call. She did not even know that the Criminal Code required conditions to be existing before a warrantless search could be made in exigent circumstances. Clearly, those conditions for a warrant did not exist. She did not even realize until trial that she had arbitrarily detained the two accuseds in the police cars without giving them their s. 10 rights.",outcome

 R. v. Sunshine,dec_name
Appearances: Counsel for the Crown: Elliot Poll James Cryder Counsel for the Accused: John Gustafson,counsel
The Honourable Mr. Justice Myers,judge
"Because there was some evidence presented by the Crown which, if believed, could support the conclusion that the accused meant to cause bodily harm to Isabella that he knew was likely to cause her death, and was reckless as to whether death ensued or not, the jury is entitled to conclude that the accused was guilty of second­degree murder, pursuant to s. 229(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. Thus, there will be no directed verdict of acquittal on that charge. The application is dismissed.",outcome
"An autopsy was performed by Dr. Lee who testified at the trial. He determined that the cause of death was blunt force abdominal injuries. Dr. Lee also opined that there had likely been recurrent injuries to the mesentery other than the fatal blow, based on evidence that he found of trauma in various stages of healing and scarring. Dr. Lee also testified that it was unlikely that the fatal injury to the mesentery could have occurred from falling on a plastic ring toy or on the edge of the bathtub. Dr. Lee also found evidence of bruising on the sides of Isabella’s head, although there was no accompanying fracture of the underlying skull. The bruises were covered by Isabella’s hair which was removed during the autopsy. Therefore, they would not have been readily apparent prior to the autopsy, nor ­ in contrast to the burn marks ­ were they noted by anybody. Similar to the trauma to the mesentery, the bruises on the head were in various stages of healing. Dr. Lee’s opinion was that these were likely caused by repetitive injuries. With respect to the timing of the injuries, in Dr. Lee’s opinion, the fatal blow to the abdomen occurred not more than six hours prior to Isabella’s death. Additionally, based on his microscopic tissue analysis, Dr. Lee stated that some of the bruising to the sides of Isabella’s head likely took place from six hours prior to immediately prior to Isabella’s death.",facts

 R. v. Sunshine,dec_name
Appearances: Counsel for the Crown: James Cryder Elliot Poll Counsel for the Accused: John Gustafson,counsel
The Honourable Mr. Justice Myers,judge
"Taking the “claimant­centred” approach that was set out in Grant, and considering the factors that the Supreme Court outlined in determining whether a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have believed that he or she was detained and had no choice but to comply with the police, a “detention” for Charter purposes occurred when Mr. Sunshine was placed in the private room at the hospital. Until that point a reasonable person would have believed – and Mr. Sunshine did believe – that the police were helping him, not detaining him. However, when Mr. Sunshine was placed in a room under guard and kept from his family and the general public, a detention crystallized. From that point until the end of his interview at the police station, no action was taken by the police to undo that psychological detention. Both the first statement at Mr. Sunshine’s house and the second statement at the police station were made by Mr. Sunshine voluntarily. They are thus presumptively admissible. Since the detention occurred after Mr. Sunshine made the first statement, it follows that his s. 10 Charter rights were not breached in obtaining that statement. There is thus no reason to exclude it from trial. However, the accused was detained while he made the second statement to police. Mr. Sunshine was not advised of his s. 10 rights before making the statement, and thus the statement was obtained in breach of those rights. The Crown has conceded that s. 24(2) applies to exclude the statement, should I find that it was obtained in breach of the Charter. Therefore the statement made by the accused at the police station on December 18, 2005, is excluded from the trial.",outcome
"On December 17, 2008, Mr. Sunshine, Ms. Rain and their two children, Isabella and Devina, were at home watching television. Shortly after she was put to bed by the accused, Isabella started moaning and went into distress. Mr. Sunshine called 911. An ambulance arrived at 00:04 on December 18 and transported Ms. Rain and Isabella to the Vancouver Children’s Hospital. Mr. Sunshine remained in the residence with Devina. Isabella died at 00:51.At approximately 2:30 a.m. on December 18, 2005, Constables Chambers, Weins and Lawson, of the Vancouver Police Department, went to Mr. Sunshine’s and Ms. Rain’s residence to inform Mr. Sunshine that Isabella had died. They did so at the direction of Sgt. Johnson.At some point shortly after their arrival, Mr. Sunshine indicated to one of the officers that he wanted them to leave. They went outside briefly but then insisted on coming back inside and staying, because they felt he should not be left alone in his current state of mind. They informed Mr. Sunshine of that and said they were there to provide emotional support.When the officers went back in the house, Cst. Chambers resumed a general conversation he had been having with Mr. Sunshine before the officers temporarily left. Cst. Chambers asked Mr. Sunshine what had happened. It is Mr. Sunshine’s response to that question that is the first statement in issue.The officers at the residence were then contacted by Sgt. Johnson, who told them that the death was regarded as “suspicious” and that they were to secure the home as a possible crime scene. As such, their instructions were to remove everyone from the home and prevent other people from going in. One of the officers contacted emergency services and arranged for Mr. Sunshine and Devina, who was less than a year old at the time, to be transported by ambulance to Children’s Hospital.",facts

Although he had worked as a mechanical engineer and project manager in Iran, his professional credentials were not recognized in Canada. In January, 2000, Mr. Arasteh took a job with Best Buy as a commissioned salesman at a Future Shop retail store in West Vancouver. He worked as a salesman in the store’s large appliances division until March 2006 when he transferred at his request to the home theatre division.

Poulin was in the bathroom and the respondent was yelling at him. The respondent then stood over the victim and yelled, “Fuck you, fuckin skank, don’t ever come back here again. You got it?” The respondent left the apartment with the knife and disposed of it. The victim described the knife as 8 to 10 inches long. The victim required surgery and stitches to repair a cut tendon in her arm, and wore a cast for several months. She described ongoing psychological harm. Poulin also bled from his hands and forehead, but did not tell the police how he received those injuries. The respondent testified that Poulin received the injuries while trying to protect the victim. Poulin died (of causes unrelated to this incident) before trial.",facts

"In this case, at minimum, the evidence shows that the appellant was in the course of causing the trailer to become movable. The offence was established. In result, the appeal from the conviction of break, enter the theft is allowed and is set aside. A conviction for theft, pursuant to count 2, is entered. The matter is remitted to the trial judge for resentencing.",outcome
"The appellant, Kevin Ausland, appeals his conviction for break, enter and theft pursuant to sections 348(1)(b) and (e) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C46 (Code). The facts are these. Rona Distribution Ltd. owns an overflow yard which is used for the purpose of storing trailers. The yard is a former parking lot of a drivein movie theatre and is unfenced. The only physical thing controlling access and egress to the property is a chain between two cement posts which spans the road giving vehicle access to the yard. While vehicular access to the yard is controlled by this means, there is no physical barrier impeding pedestrian access. The yard is patrolled by security guards and cameras. On the evening of September 7, 2007, two men were observed backing a truck tractor up to the chain. The chain was secured by a padlock. They apparently cut through the chain and backed the tractor unit up to a trailer parked in the lot. The tractor and trailer were connected and the unit was ready to be pulled, when the police arrived in response to an emergency call. In the end, nothing was removed from the yard. Ausland was charged and convicted of breaking and entering a place, and committing a theft therein. He was also found guilty of theft over $5,000, under section 334 of the Code, but that conviction was stayed under the principle set out in R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC),  1 S.C.R. 729.

"Furthermore, I cannot think that such a distinction would be in the minds of the parties to an “all risk” policy. There is no reason to suspect that an insured who buys an “all risk” policy in relation to a commercial building would intend the exclusion of settlement type damages arising from unnatural causes on the basis of this exclusion clause. Likewise, it is illogical to think that an insurer of an “all risk” policy would have intended to shield itself behind an exclusion clause if the accident produced settling, as opposed to any other type of damage. If the parties intended such an anomalous result, they should have said so in the contract. In the absence of express language to that effect, it seems clear that neither party intended that result and I conclude that the appellant’s position belies its intention at the time it entered into the contract. For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Judgment accordingly.",outcome
"The facts giving rise to the appeal are not disputed. The respondent owns a commercial building located on 13th Avenue and 1st Street S.W., Calgary. It leased the premises to a number of commercial tenants, and secured an “all risk” insurance policy. The appellant insurer later assumed the policy and renewed it from time to time, such that the policy was in effect at all relevant times. In July 2006, construction began on a highrise condominium project located adjacent to the respondent’s building. After the lot was excavated several stories deep, tenants in the respondent’s building began to notice cracks developing in the floors, walls and ceilings. They complained to the respondent, who reported the matter to the appellant. All agreed that the building had been in good condition and repair prior to the commencement of the construction. The respondent’s proof of loss claim was denied by the appellant on the basis that the policy excludes loss or damage caused by earth movement and settlement. The respondent retained Anast Demitt, a structural engineer, to inspect the building to ascertain the cause and extent of the damage, and to estimate the cost of repair. Mr. Demitt concluded that the damage was caused by the excavation activity on the adjacent lot, specifically by inadequate underpinnings and shoring, together with vibrations, shaking and the destabilizing effects of the deep excavation. He found that, as a result, the respondent’s building sustained settlement of the structural frame and the floor slabs. Photographs, entered by agreement in the court below, show extensive damage to the building with massive cracks in the floors, walls and ceilings. Mr. Demitt estimated the cost of repair to be in the range of $1,000,000. His report itself did not form part of the evidence, but was described in the affidavit of Raphael Engle. The question of the appellant’s liability was put before a chambers judge. By then, the appellant had abandoned its argument that the earth movement exclusion clause applied and relied solely on the settlement exclusion clause to deny coverage.",facts

And on that basis he increased his bid by 200,000 which brings his offer to 2.3 million dollars cash.” (A.B. Record Digest, 13/2736) He submitted that Mr. Warkentin’s offer be accepted. In response, counsel for the Receiver advised the Court that he had been in written communication with counsel for Mr. Warkentin “and there was no indication in that correspondence that he thought he would get [possession of the lands] in the fall.” (Appeal Record Digest, 14/1820) He added: “I think the tender package is clear that the way it was supposed to close is after the appeal periods on any order has expired. ... So how anybody could reasonably conceive that possession wouldn’t be granted until the fall based on that escapes me.” (Appeal Record Digest, 14/2025) He further added: “But the bottom line was at the time tenders closed, Mr. [Warkentin]’s offer was found wanting.” (Appeal Record Digest, 14/3638)",facts

The two orders arise in proceedings instituted by the applicant following the seizure by the respondent of some animals in the applicant’s possession. Amongst other things, the December 21 order establishes a procedure for adoption out by the respondent of some of the seized animals. It provides that if any of the animals are adopted out under the procedure, the adoption is without prejudice and without admission of liability by either the applicant or the respondent. The January 5 order provides that after 5:00 p.m. on January 12, 2010 the respondent may adopt out any of the remaining animals and that the adoption out of any animals will be without prejudice to any future claims for damages and costs.

Facts The Applicant, Mary Koma lived with William Tomich for 26 years. They never married. Tomich died on July 30, 2008. At the time of death, the parties resided in a house located at Brule, Alberta. Title to the residence, which is free and clear of all encumbrances, was in the name of the deceased only. Shortly before his death, the deceased purchased a new vehicle for the Applicant. The deceased, who is divorced, executed a Will on October 18, 2007. He also executed a Codicil on May 30, 2008, under which he gave the Applicant a life estate in the Brule property, a one-half interest in it if she voluntarily moved, together with a one-third interest in the residue. The Brule property is valued at $380,000. He was divorced from their mother. The other beneficiaries are his two adult children who are named as personal representatives. The Respondents admit that the Applicant is a dependant within the meaning of the Dependants Relief Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. D-10.5, (Act) and that she was his adult interdependent partner by virtue of the Adult Interdependent Relationships Act, Statutes of Alberta, 2002, c. A- 4.5.

"It is now more than two years after the date of the accident. Does the proposed alternative claim against the alleged driver J. Gill (that he is the owner of the vehicle) “change the capacity” in which J. Gill is sued? In my view it does not. A “change of capacity” refers to whether a defendant is sued in his personal capacity or sued in a representative capacity: see Crane v. Brentridge Ford Sales Ltd., 2008 CarswellAlta 805, 2008 ABCA 216, 437 A.R. 160 (C.A.) at paragraphs 11 and 12. As a result, Singh does not need to meet the more stringent requirements of Section 6(4) of the Limitations Act which apply when a plaintiff wishes to change the capacity in which it sues a defendant. Instead, Singh merely needs to meet the requirement of Section 6(2) of the Limitations Act by showing that the proposed added claim against J. Gill is related to the conduct, transaction or events described in the existing pleadings against J. Gill. Clearly that requirement has been met.

Honourable Madam Justice J.E. Topolniski,judge
"Ms. Lalonde has conceded that her first statement is admissible, implicitly agreeing that it was voluntary. In terms of the second statement, she raised only the s. 10(b) concern. I have had the opportunity to review the recording of the second interview and am satisfied that her statement, in fact, was made voluntarily. There were no threats or promises, oppression, or police trickery. Ms. Lalonde was treated fairly throughout the interview. She appeared to have been sober, and although she was upset at times, there is nothing to suggest that she was under any physical or emotional burden that would have caused her to cease to have an operating mind. The evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Lalonde's statement was made freely, voluntarily and was the product of an operating mind.",outcome
"Aaron Mathias and Rochelle Lalonde are charged with the second degree murder of Debbie Elly-Smith, who was also known as Alabama. The issue in this voir dire is the 2010 ABQB 54 (CanLII) Page: 2 admissibility of statements given by Mr. Mathias and Ms. Lalonde to Detective Draganiuk of the Edmonton Police Service (“EPS”). The Crown seeks to establish the voluntariness of the statements while the Accused seek their exclusion. Mr. Mathias alleges a s. 10(b) Charter breach, contending that the failure to advise him of his right to immediately consult with counsel and of the availability of free legal services and duty counsel warrants the exclusion of his statement. Also, Mr. Mathias disputes the voluntariness of his statement of April 6, 2008, asserting that he was offered inducements in the form of eligibility for the witness protection program and becoming Det. Draganiuk's “star witness.” He maintains that the voluntariness of his statement was further affected by Det. Draganiuk persuading him to provide a KGB statement even though the detective was uncertain at the time whether Mr. Mathias was a witness or a suspect.  Ms. Lalonde gave two statements. She asks that the second statement, made April 8, 2008, be excluded as a remedy for what she alleges was a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights when the police failed to accommodate her request to consult with counsel a second time. She does not dispute that the first statement, made January 26, 2007, is admissible. Neither Mr. Mathias nor Ms. Lalonde gave evidence at the voir dire.",facts

The jury could not reach a verdict on two counts of uttering threats on 10 August 2005, and the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on those two counts. The jury found the appellant not guilty on an amended Count 4, “[Using] an imitation firearm while committing or attempting to commit the indictable offence of obstructing justice”, on or about 10 August 2005. The main issue at trial was the appellant’s identity as one of three young men who entered the home of two brothers, Mandave and Balkar Heer on 10 August 2005, and by threats and intimidation attempted to persuade the brothers to make Balkar’s friend, Mitul Devia, change his evidence in the pending trial of the appellant’s father, Roy Dalen, from what Devia had said in a statement to police.",facts

The relationship is said to arise out of the facts that they involve, at least to some extent, the same parties, the appellants being the same parties all proceedings, the respondent being either a party or represented by parties in the other proceedings, and that they all arise out of a dispute that has been ongoing between the appellants and the Strata corporation in which the appellants own two units.

"Mr. Vesuna has challenged specific items in the bill of costs on the basis that they were excessive in all of the circumstances. It is the Registrar’s responsibility to determine whether a bill of costs is a reasonable bill of costs. In this case, theRegistrar made that determination. I am not in a position today to say that the Registrar made any error in principle or that the Registrar was clearly wrong. I do not know what evidence was before the Registrar and Mr. Vesuna has not presented any evidence in respect of these items, apart from his oral assertions, that would support his objections. I am therefore unable to accede to Mr. Vesuna’s submission that the Registrar’s decision should be varied and I reject that aspect of his application, as well. In the result, Mr. Vesuna’s applications are dismissed.",outcome
"Mr. Vesuna says that, while he was out of Canada from about June 8, 2008 until the end of November 2008, none of his mail was forwarded to him during his travels and that he did not see any of the materials sent to him by the respondent and did not learn of the certificate of costs until December 2008. He says on February 9, 2009 he filed an application for leave to appeal this Court’s judgment and the award of costs to the Supreme Court of Canada. That application for leave was refused in July 2009. As noted, the Rules provide for a review of an assessment within seven days of the assessment. Thus, the time limit for Mr. Vesuna’s application was August 14, 2008. He filed his motion December 31, 2009, more than a year and four months out of time. Although it is a fair inference from what Mr. Vesuna has told me that he formed an intention to appeal the assessment when he learned of it, it does not appear that he notified the respondent of this intention until the past week or so. The circumstances do not warrant an extension of time. Nevertheless, I will deal with Mr. Vesuna’s submissions.",facts

In the course of the altercation Mr. Melanson suffered six wounds one of which, an injury to the right side of his neck, was fatal.

Since these offences occurred after certain amendments to the Criminal Code had come into force on November 1, 2005, there exist mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for these offences. The offence of making child pornography has a minimum term of one year, the offence of possessing child pornography has a minimum term of 45 days, and the offence of invitation to sexual touching involving a child under the age of 14, has a minimum term of 45 days.

Given the disposition of the appeal, I am not persuaded the appellant can be said to have achieved the same degree of success on the claims before the trial court. While he has succeeded in having the respondent’s trust claims dismissed, the respondent succeeded on her claim for spousal support, which the appellant opposed at trial and which was upheld on appeal. In view of the parties’ divided success on their respective claims advanced at the trial of the action, I would order that each bear their own costs in the court below.",outcome

The respondent also sought an award of spousal support. The appellant opposed all of the respondent’s claims and counterclaimed for a monetary award for unjust enrichment, or alternatively a declaration of trust in the assets held by the respondent, as a result of his direct and indirect contributions during the relationship.

At trial, the appellant was convicted on one count of robbery and one count of aggravated assault. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 12 years for the robbery conviction, but gave the appellant credit for 18 months in recognition of the 9 months he had served in pre-trial custody.

The defendant does not have the capacity at this time to find and keep fulltime employment. She requires help in setting goals and achieving those goals in terms of running her own home. I have the impression that she struggles to find things to do with A.S. during their access visits. That is not unexpected given the limited amount of time she has spent with A.S. and I do not criticize her for it but simply observe that I expect that A.S. would find it difficult to spend lengthy periods with her away from his routine and other family. Furthermore, the defendant’s apartment is not well equipped for extended stays in that there is only one bedroom and A.S. is now of an age when his privacy and personal space are more important than when he was a young child. However, I believe that the occasional overnight access is appropriate and will allow A.S. and his mother to carry on a more normal parentchild relationship.",outcome

The defendant, who has experienced mental health issues since before the child’s birth, concedes that the primary residence of the child should remain with the plaintiff but she seeks a greater role in the care and upbringing of her son than she has enjoyed during the past several years. She believes that her mental health is stable and that there is no reason why she cannot share custody with the plaintiff in an effective way.The plaintiff professes to want the defendant to be more involved with the child and have greater access to him but submits that her mental health issues make it inappropriate that she share custody and require the need for caution with regard to both the amount and nature of the access that the defendant has with the child.",facts

"Even if the defendant’s application could be seen as legitimately aimed at a redistribution of access costs, I find that the defendant has not relied upon the proper legislative authority. The court does, of course, have jurisdiction to apportion access costs between parents as an adjunct of a custody order, but the more usual and regular route to apportionment is via s. 10 of the Child Support Guidelines. In the present case, the defendant pays approximately $2,600 per month in child support. That comes to $31,000 per year, and that essentially equals the defendant’s calculation of the cost of three access visits to Canada per year. It was, I think, incumbent on the defendant to demonstrate that s. 10 of the Guidelines could not provide the relief he desired before he asked the court to fiddle withthe parties’ agreement on custody. The defendant’s application is, therefore, dismissed.",outcome

For her part, the plaintiff seeks various orders, the general effect of which would be to require the defendant to pay the lump sum spousal support he agreed to give her as part of the settlement. These applications require the court to decide whether the principle of issue estoppel stands in the way of the defendant’s application, whether the defendant’s application amounts to a variation of custody and access provisions of the consent order, and whether the cost of access should be taken out of the spousal support account or pursuant to s. 10 of the Child Support Guidelines.",facts

"At para.143 of the judgment, I found that as between the plaintiff and her brothers there were reciprocal and reasonable expectations that the plaintiff would not bear all of the reasonable costs of their mother’s care for the last four years of her life in Guatemala. Thepersonal defendants knew or ought to have known before the death of the testatrix that the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of some reimbursement for her care of their mother. This was not a case where, due to lack of notice of the plaintiff’s claim, it would have been impossible for the personal defendants to make restitution before delivery of the statement of claim. The estate will pay to the plaintiff court order interest calculated on the amount of the judgment in this case from October 29, 2006, the date on which the cause of action arose, to the date of judgment at the Registrar’s rates.",outcome
"The plaintiff submits that she was substantially successful in her claim and should have her costs paid out of the estate as party and party costs at Scale B.

The personal defendants submit that costs should be apportioned between the plaintiff and them in proportion to their relative degrees of success. The personal defendants say that they should pay to the plaintiff 20 percent of her Scale B costs, and that they should receive 80 percent of their Scale B costs from the plaintiff.Regarding interest, the personal defendants say that they did not have notice of the plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim until September 20, 2008 when the plaintiff delivered her statement of claim and a list of documents which included particulars of the expenses she claimed for their mother’s care. They submit that in these circumstances it would unfair to require payment of prejudgment interest for any period antecedent to the delivery of the plaintiff’s statement of claim. The defendant Royal Trust submits that its costs for legal services related to this litigation should be paid out of the estate as reasonable executor expenses.

" David Carl Sunshine stands charged with the second­degree murder of his stepdaughter, Isabella Rain­Ayala, who was approximately two and a half years old at the time of her death in the early morning hours of December 18, 2005.  At the close of the Crown’s case, the accused made an application for a directed verdict, arguing that the Crown’s evidence was insufficient to establish the mens rea for second­degree murder. He argued that only a charge with respect to manslaughter should be left with the jury. I rejected the application of the accused, with reasons to follow. These are my reasons",facts
" Because there was some evidence presented by the Crown which, if believed, could support the conclusion that the accused meant to cause bodily harm to Isabella that he knew was likely to cause her death, and was reckless as to whether death ensued or not, the jury is entitled to conclude that the accused was guilty of second­degree murder, pursuant to s. 229(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. Thus, there will be no directed verdict of acquittal on that charge. The application is dismissed.",outcome

"a. The initial police visit and the first statement  On December 17, 2008, Mr. Sunshine, Ms. Rain and their two children, Isabella and Devina, were at home watching television. Shortly after she was put to bed by the accused, Isabella started moaning and went into distress. Mr. Sunshine called 911. An ambulance arrived at 00:04 on December 18 and transported Ms. Rain and Isabella to the Vancouver Children’s Hospital. Mr. Sunshine remained in the residence with Devina. Isabella died at 00:51.  At approximately 2:30 a.m. on December 18, 2005, Constables Chambers, Weins and Lawson, of the Vancouver Police Department, went to Mr. Sunshine’s and Ms. Rain’s residence to inform Mr. Sunshine that Isabella had died. They did so at the direction of Sgt. Johnson.",facts
" Both the first statement at Mr. Sunshine’s house and the second statement at the police station were made by Mr. Sunshine voluntarily. They are thus presumptively admissible. Since the detention occurred after Mr. Sunshine made the first statement, it follows that his s. 10 Charter rights were not breached in obtaining that statement. There is thus no reason to exclude it from trial.  However, the accused was detained while he made the second statement to police. Mr. Sunshine was not advised of his s. 10 rights before making the statement, and thus the statement was obtained in breach of those rights. The Crown has conceded that s. 24(2) applies to exclude the statement, should I find that it was obtained in breach of the Charter. Therefore the statement made by the accused at the police station on December 18, 2005, is excluded from the trial.",outcome

STINSON J.,judge
"The business relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant spanned a period of approximately two years, between May 2005 and May 2007. Over that timeframe the defendant was engaged in five house construction projects at various locations in the City of Toronto. The following table sets out the addresses, names of the owner and the timeframe over which the plaintiff’s records reflect shipments to those job sites:",facts
"The plaintiff also shipped a minor amount of lumber to a project at 38 Senlac, the house next door to the defendant’s wife’s house, after the defendant introduced the owner of that site to the plaintiff’s principal, Fred Rosenberg. The plaintiff concedes that it billed the defendant for that lumber in error, a total of $426.76, and it is prepared to reduce its claim accordingly.",facts
"The business relationship between these two parties was relatively informal. The order taking, filling and delivery process at the plaintiff was as follows. Mr. Rosenberg would receive a telephone request from Mr. Bodrenok for materials required at the job site. Mr. Rosenberg would write by hand the details of the order on a numbered business form, which produced three copies. One copy was kept by the plaintiff for purposes of tax reporting. The second and third copies were used to assemble the order and were shipped with the goods (a packing slip and a receipt). Upon delivery of the goods, the recipient would (if available) sign the receipt copy of the packing slip, which would be returned to the plaintiff and used to generate an invoice bearing the same number. The other copy of the packing slip would remain with the goods as delivered. The invoice would then be mailed or delivered to the defendant.",facts
"In relation to certain of the projects in which Mr. Bodrenok was involved, the plaintiff had some involvement in the design of the framing systems for the structures in question. Mr. Bodrenok would provide Mr. Rosenberg with a copy of the plans for the building, which in turn would be passed onto an engineer who could determine what quantities of so-called “engineered wood beams” were required for specific load-bearing aspects of the construction. These load-bearing beams are sometimes known as laminated veneer lumber, or “LVLs”. Mr. Rosenberg would return the framing design plans and information to Mr. Bodrenok so he would be aware of the quantities of LVLs that he would require in due course. Once he needed them on the job site, Mr. Bodrenok would place orders for the required LVLs with Mr. Rosenberg.",facts
"For these reasons, in response to the first question posed, I conclude that the total value of the good received by the defendant was $189,582.57. In response to the second question posed, I conclude that the plaintiff was paid $192,340.97. It follows that the defendant has paid for all of the goods delivered (leaving aside any calculation for interest on sums outstanding from time to time). There being no unpaid debt proved, the action must be dismissed.",outcome
"If the parties cannot agree on the issue of costs, they may file brief written submissions (no more than four pages) as follows: (a) defendant – within thirty (30) days; (b) plaintiff – fifteen (15) days thereafter; and (c) reply by defendant – ten (10) days thereafter",outcome

"The plaintiffs are in the business of organizing and re-branding mortgage agents across Canada under a common trade mark and name, MORTGAGEBROKERS.COM. Under this arrangement, mortgage agents can potentially access a greater marketing power. By harnessing a number of agents under its name, the plaintiffs can negotiate volume discounts and more favourable terms from lenders which are passed on to their clients. Mr. Alex Haditaghi is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of Mortgage Brokers.com.",facts
"Mr. Michael Hapke, one of the named defendants is a director of the corporate defendant 6356591 Canada Inc. He incorporated this company along with his then partner, the defendant Frank Napolitano. They are experienced mortgage brokers. Mr. Hapke met Mr. Haditaghi in 2005 and they decided to join forces. On October 11, 2005 a licensing agreement was entered into between Elite Mortgage Team operating as 6356591 Canada Inc. (“591”) as “Mortgage Consultant” and MortgageBrokers.com Financial Group of Companies Inc. (“MBCFGC Inc.”) as the “Company”. Shortly thereafter, individual agents signed agent licensing agreements incorporating the same terms. None of these individual agents have been named as parties. Under these agreements, lenders advanced money to the plaintiffs who would then receive the commissions and split them with the defendants and the agents. That split was originally 90% in favour of the partners/agents and this was later increased to 95%.",facts
"Sometime between 2007 and 2009, the defendants York Polk and Jeff Cody joined forces with Hapke and Napolitano and the interested parties began negotiating a new business arrangement. Those negotiations failed and on January 19, 2010, “591” gave notice of its resignation from the agreement. The plaintiffs then received 41 notices of resignation from the Ottawa agents. Mortgage Brokers City Inc. then began operations shortly thereafter.",facts

"Const. Carrabs, as a member of the Peel Regional Police Service Street Crime Unit for about 3½ years, spent nearly 90 percent of his duties investigating illicit narcotic transactions. The Unit frequently depended on informants for information regarding illegal drug dealing. At times, Const. Carrabs, and others in the Unit, employed the “cold call” approach. Acting on minimal information about an unknown target, frequently from a confidential informant, a telephone call would be made to the target with a view to setting up a drug deal.",facts
"A day or two before September 5, 2008, Const. Carrabs received an unsolicited phonecall from a confidential informant (the CI). He used this source ten times over a two-year period with eight or nine occasions preceding September 5, 2008.",facts
"In the telephone call, the CI reported that a black male in his twenties, with a goatee, was dealing crack cocaine in Brampton. The male used the name “Bizz”, drove a black-coloured vehicle, and could be reached by phoning (647) 885-3763.",facts
Const. Carrabs did not inquire as to the source of the CI’s information. Nor did he ask the CI the reason the information was being reported. The CI was involved in the drug sub-culture. He assumed the phone number came to the CI directly from Bizz but could not discount that the number may have originated from a third party.,facts
"Given that Const. Carrabs testified that in each instance when he received information from the CI he met the CI along with a second officer, it seems that he may also have met the CI prior to the September 5, 2008 phonecall placed to Bizz although the evidence on this point is not entirely clear.",facts
"Const. Carrabs did not perform a subscriber check on the phone number given for Bizz essentially because he was pressed for time. He did not know Bizz or the phone number provided. He considered “Bizz” to be a nickname and likely an attempt, as was the case with some drug dealers, to hide true identity. In the past, subscriber checks with phone utilities had successfully resulted in identification of a target’s identity, vehicle information, etc. On other occasions, the phone was discovered not to be registered to the person being targetted.",facts

The genesis of this evidence was the appellant’s DNA which was on file at the Centre of Forensic Sciences as a result of a police investigation of three charges of sexual assault, one of which resulted in the appellant’s conviction for sexual assault with a weapon in 1995. The appellant does not dispute that the DNA sample was seized as incident to a lawful arrest.

The deceased was clothed from the waist up and her legs were bound by a section of telephone cord.

However, as both Roscoe and counsel for the respondents made generous reference to the fresh evidence, we admitted it.The thrust of Roscoe's position, the foundation of all of his arguments in relation to both appeals, is that his arrangement of a first mortgage with Elle and a second mortgage with Sub-Prime were a single package that was divided into the two mortgages by Walman. He argues that since the two mortgages were intrinsically linked, that it was the failure of Sub-Prime to advance funds that caused him to default on the Elle mortgage.",facts

For the purposes of considering the availability of the various configurations of self-defence, we must take the best case for the appellant, which was his own description of the event. Where other witnesses differed, I have included some of their observations. Intending to start a new life in Sault Ste. Marie, the appellant rented a room in a house and spent the next day, October 1, 2004, fishing. He returned at night carrying his gear, went to a pub then walked home. As he neared his new home, he encountered the deceased, McWatch (also known as Witzell), walking with his girlfriend. There were in fact two girls walking home with McWatch. The deceased was quite drunk (his blood alcohol ratio was later tested at 197 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood), and was calling out to people as he walked along. When the appellant stepped off the sidewalk to let McWatch’s group pass, McWatch called him a “fuck’n nigger.” (The appellant is not a black man.) The appellant recalled that he raised his hands and said “I don’t know what it is but I don’t want anything to do with it.” And McWatch responded: “So that’s how it’s going to be, eh?

WHITTEN J. ,judge
"From all of the above, it is evident that this litigation was amplified and rendered progressively more counterproductive by the attitude of the respondent/father and his counsel at trial. In fact, by the trial their approach appears to be an all out fight for what could have been so easily resolvable through level headed mediation or discussion between counsel. Therefore the applicant/mother is entitled to her costs on a substantial indemnity basis. The account submitted appears appropriate. One notes that counsel for the Applicant charged an hourly throughout the trial rather than a counsel fee per day which is usually the case. That method would probably make for a reduced bill. Two hundred hours for a ten day trial and litigation over three years is not unreasonable. The disbursements are understandable.This Court orders that the Respondent therefore pay $56,233.31 to the Applicant for her costs herein (40% of which as noted was in relation to support issues and therefore is enforceable through the Family Responsibility Office).The Court recognizes that this amount will no doubt be a tremendous burden for the Respondent, yet he could have so easily avoided this liability by being receptive to resolution. At the end of the day the Respondent brought this burden upon himself.",outcome

There was no such agreement.The Applicant filed her submissions May 7, 2009. The Respondent neither responded to those submissions nor filed any original submissions.The judgment awarded the Applicant sole custody and reduced the access enjoyed by the Respondent by one overnight access. The judgment was quite advantageous to the Applicant in that she now has ultimate decision making power with respect to the children. This control is greater than would exist in a joint custody regime. However, it was the latter that the Applicant had 1) proposed through her solicitor in July 2007 and in 2) in a formal offer dated November 26, 2009.

"In my view, it was reasonable for the Defendant to bring the motion for a further and better Affidavit of Documents. However, by failing to accept the terms of the Plaintiff’s Offer to Settle the Appeal and to amend the Reply to Request to Admit, the Defendant forced the hearing of the Appeal and the Plaintiff’s motion and the Plaintiff was successful on both and is entitled to its costs. In reviewing the hours of counsel for the Plaintiff, I find that 58.9 hours of lawyer time is excessive, given the nature of the Appeal and the motion. I make the following costs Orders: a. The Plaintiff is to pay to the Defendant its costs of bringing the motion for a further and better Affidavit of Documents, which I fix at $3,750.00, an amount I consider to be fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances; b. TheDefendantistopaytothePlaintiffitscostsofthemotiontoamendtheReply to the Request to Admit and the costs of the Appeal of Master Muir’s Order which I fix in the sum of $17,500 plus GST of $875 plus disbursements of $834.10 for a total of $19,209.10; c.

The bulk of the $24,610.83 figure is the costs on a substantial indemnity scale because the Plaintiff had delivered an Offer to Settle the Appeal on November 20, 2009 before the factum and book of authorities had been prepared which, it is submitted, was not accepted by opposing counsel and the Plaintiff obtained a result that was more favourable than the terms of the Offer to Settle that had been delivered.",facts

Immediately prior to this review hearing, the Crown laid a fresh information adding the charge of manslaughter as a result of the child’s death.

From time to time the children have resided with each parent, most recently with their father. The children remained with their father after the separation, with access to their mother. A Children’s Lawyer Report in 2003 found that the father had been physically abusive towards the children and that he sometimes neglected their care. In May of 2003, the children were moved to their mother’s residence within a framework of joint custody, by order of Justice Boyko.The children again moved to their father’s residence on August 21, 2006 following on the mother’s charge of drinking and driving.

"In fixing costs for these motions I am cognizant that the matter is complex and required a good deal of preparation. Counsel were engaged in argument for the better part of two hours and Mr. Cavanagh stood by all morning as well. Mr. Cardill was engaged in another matter most of the morning. I think these motions must be blamed, at least in part, on the shifting procedures being adopted by the plaintiff, even though he has secured all the relief he sought at this point. I think an appropriate costs award in the circumstance is that the plaintiff receives costs fixed at $6,000 from the defendants within thirty (30) days.",outcome

or his lawyers have been responsible has been such as to give rise to 
the substantial risk that a fair trial of the issues in the litigation will

"In Woodheath Developments Ltd. v. Goldman Can LII-2001 28019, 
Master Dash reviewed the relevant case law through the years and 
concluded that, even in the absence of delay that was intentional and 
contumelious, the court could dismiss an action for delay in the 
following circumstances:

The delay, caused by the plaintiff or his counsel, was inordinate and inexcusable;

The delay gives rise to a presumption of prejudice, in the sense that a fair trial

would not be possible by the time the matter was likely to get to trial;

Inordinate delay will give rise to a presumption of prejudice, as the memories of witnesses tend to fade;

Undue delay after the expiry of the applicable limitation period will also result in a presumption of prejudice;

Where a presumption of prejudice arises, the onus is on the plaintiff to rebut the presumption;

The presumption of prejudice would be displayed, on proper evidence, to the effect that the outcome at trial would not be dependent on the memory of witnesses, that the witnesses that are available recall their evidence in detail or that the case turns largely on the documents;

If the plaintiff does rebut the presumption of prejudice, the onus shifts to the defendant to lead convincing evidence of actual prejudice.",outcome

denies that it entered into an oral, or indeed any, contract with the Plaintiffs regarding online ordering. It is asserted that 
although Domino's discussed with the Plaintiffs the possibility of adding online ordering to its website, those discussions 
amounted to, at most, an “agreement to agree” which was not enforceable or binding. Further, Domino's states in its defence
that during the initial discussions with the Plaintiffs, Domino's made it clear that it would not assume any 
obligations without first signing a comprehensive written contract.",facts

tailored by the co-plaintiffs at their respective examinations for discovery” and that without clear evidence to justify 
excluding a party from the examinations for discovery no such order should be made.

"This position is to be contrasted with counsel for the two defendants who notes that although the onus of establishing 
cause is on the party seeking the exclusion, the courts have repeatedly recognized that the onus is lighter where (i) the 
exclusion is sought on discoveries, rather than at trial, and (ii) 
the exclusion of co-parties is sought, rather than the exclusion of parties who are adverse in interest.",facts
